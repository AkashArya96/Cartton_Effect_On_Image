# Cartoon_Effect_On_Image

The goal of my project is to create a cartoon image using the K-means clustering method in machine learning. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together based on their features. By applying this method to cartoon images, I can automatically segment and group pixels with similar color values, creating distinct regions and boundaries. This allows for the creation of visually appealing and vibrant cartoon-like images. The project explores the application of machine learning techniques in the domain of image processing, showcasing the potential of K-means clustering in generating unique and artistic cartoon-style visuals.

# Libraries
1) OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library for image and video processing. It provides various functions and algorithms to manipulate, analyze, and enhance images. I used OpenCV to load and preprocess the input image, perform color space conversions, and apply image segmentation techniques.

2) NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient array operations and mathematical functions. I leveraged NumPy to handle the numerical operations involved in the K-means clustering algorithm, such as calculating distances between data points and centroids, and updating cluster assignments.

By incorporating these libraries into my project, I was able to leverage their functionality and capabilities to effectively implement the K-means method for generating cartoon images.
